## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Customize your e-ink display with modules such as:
  - **Traffic Incidents**: Stay informed with live traffic updates using the [TomTom Traffic API](https://developer.tomtom.com).
  - **News Headlines**: Get updates from outlets like [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com) and [El Pa√≠s](https://elpais.com), supporting news in both English and Spanish.
  - **Stock Prices**: Track the latest stock prices using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) (powered by Yahoo! Finance).
  - **Weather Forecast**: Receive real-time weather updates via the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com).
  - **Email Alerts** (in progress): Soon to support notifications from [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) and [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com).

- **Web-Based GUI**: The drag-and-drop web interface makes configuring and managing modules effortless, even for those without technical expertise.

- **Real-Time Updates**: Modules pull live data from external APIs, ensuring the information displayed is always fresh and accurate.

- **One-Click Installation**: With a simple one-command setup, even first-time users can get started in minutes.

- **Cross-Language Support**: The News module currently supports English and Spanish, with plans to expand to other languages in the future.

- **Runs on Raspberry Pi**: Designed to work seamlessly on Raspberry Pi devices, Display Hub is lightweight and energy-efficient, making it perfect for home projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up Display Hub on your e-ink display:

### 1. Hardware Requirements

Ensure you have the following hardware:

- **Raspberry Pi**: Refer to the list of supported models [here](https://jcari-dev.github.io/display-hub-e-ink-display-dashboard-docs/docs/resources/supported-pi-models).

- **E-Ink Display**: Refer to the list of supported display models [here](https://jcari-dev.github.io/display-hub-e-ink-display-dashboard-docs/docs/resources/supported-displays).

- **Secondary Device (Optional)**: A device with a desktop environment is required to access the web GUI. While this should work on Raspberry Pi's with a desktop environment, it has not been tested.

### 2. Software Requirements

Ensure you meet the [software requirements.](https://jcari-dev.github.io/display-hub-e-ink-display-dashboard-docs/docs/quickstart/software-requirements)


### 3. Connecting the Screen

To connect the e-Paper display (assuming it is a [Waveshare2in13 V4](https://www.waveshare.com/2.13inch-e-paper-hat.htm) model) to a Raspberry Pi, connect each pin on the display to the corresponding GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi as shown in the table below:

| e-Paper Connector | Raspberry Pi Pin (Board) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| VCC               | 3.3V (Pin 1)             |
| GND               | GND (Pins 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34, or 39) |
| DIN               | GPIO 10 (MOSI, Pin 19)   |
| CLK               | GPIO 11 (SCLK, Pin 23)   |
| CS                | GPIO 8 (CE0, Pin 24)     |
| DC                | GPIO 25 (Pin 22)         |
| RST               | GPIO 17 (Pin 11)         |
| BUSY              | GPIO 24 (Pin 18)         |

For reference, you can find a detailed pin layout of the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins on the [Pinout.xyz website](https://pinout.xyz).

Depending on the model of the e-Paper screen, you may also be able to connect the display directly as a HAT. Refer to the supported displays guide for more details.

### 4. Installation

After ensuring that you meet both the hardware and software requirements and that your display is connected, run the following command in your Pi's terminal:

```bash
curl -S https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcari-dev/display-hub-e-ink-display-dashboard/refs/heads/main/setup.sh | bash
```

When the installation is successful, you should see a message indicating the local IP address to access the web GUI. Upon accessing the provided URL, you will be redirected to the homepage.
